# telecom_churn_predcition
Hello DataMates!!

I worked on this project named 'Telecom churn prediction', which is basically a binary classification problem, in this scenario i have got the data from kaggle. where we have to predict the customer churn rate according to their behaviour in terms of uisng the mobile plans/services that are offered by the companies to thier customers.
